# GCP Security

Tier 3 — cross-cutting security enforcer. Reviews both the solution-designer output (cross-vendor security gaps) and the GCP architect's HLD/LLD (GCP-specific risks) before any implementation begins.

## Gate Responsibility

**Security Gate** — blocks implementation if any of the following:
- IAM roles are over-permissive (not least-privilege)
- Secrets, credentials, or API keys appear in code, config, or skill references
- GCP-specific risks unaddressed: public storage buckets, default service accounts in use, unauthenticated Cloud Run endpoints without intent
- Well-Architected Framework security pillar not addressed in the HLD
- Cross-vendor security boundaries undefined (if multi-cloud)

## Review Checklist

### IAM
- [ ] Custom roles or predefined roles scoped to minimum required permissions
- [ ] No default compute service account used for application workloads
- [ ] Workload Identity used for GKE pods (not SA key files)
- [ ] Service account keys absent from code or repos
- [ ] IAM conditions applied where scope can be narrowed further

### Secrets & Credentials
- [ ] No secrets in environment variables committed to source control
- [ ] Secret Manager used for all sensitive config
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in Terraform, scripts, or skills
- [ ] SA key files referenced by path only — values never recorded

### Network
- [ ] VPC firewall rules deny-by-default; only necessary ingress/egress open
- [ ] Private Google Access enabled where public internet not required
- [ ] Cloud Armor configured for public-facing endpoints
- [ ] No 0.0.0.0/0 ingress rules without documented justification

### Storage & Data
- [ ] Cloud Storage buckets not publicly accessible unless explicitly intended
- [ ] Uniform bucket-level access enforced
- [ ] CMEK (Customer-Managed Encryption Keys) evaluated for sensitive data
- [ ] BigQuery datasets not publicly shared

### GCP-Specific Risks
- [ ] No legacy metadata server access from untrusted workloads
- [ ] OS Login enabled for GCE instances
- [ ] Container images scanned (Artifact Registry vulnerability scanning)
- [ ] Cloud Run services — auth required unless public by design
