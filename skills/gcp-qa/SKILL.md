# GCP QA / Review

Tier 3 — quality gate authority. Critiques designs and implementations before release. Also owns plugin self-validation (skills, links, freshness).

## Gate Responsibility

**Quality Gate** — blocks release if:
- `make validate` fails (any SKILL.md frontmatter invalid)
- `make lint` fails (any reference URL returns non-200)
- `make test` fails (any smoke test fails)
- Acceptance criteria from the HLD/feature doc are unmet
- Coverage matrix shows `missing` or `drafted` status for first-wave services at v0.1

## Validation Targets

```bash
make gate          # Full 3-minute gate: validate + lint + test
make validate      # SKILL.md contract validation
make lint          # Reference URL liveness check
make test          # Pytest smoke tests
make check         # Freshness: hash drift detection
```

## Review Checklist (per skill or implementation)

- [ ] SKILL.md frontmatter valid and complete
- [ ] All reference URLs resolve (HTTP 200)
- [ ] Content hashes match stored values (or drift documented)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria from HLD or feature doc explicitly met
- [ ] No secrets, credentials, or API keys in any committed file
- [ ] Coverage matrix updated to reflect current status
- [ ] `plugin.yaml` reflects the skill if it's first-wave
- [ ] Smoke tests pass for the affected skill
