# GCP Operations / SRE

Tier 3 — cross-cutting SRE persona. Owns observability, alerting, runbooks, and production readiness for all GCP services.

## Gate Responsibility

**Operational Readiness Gate** — blocks release to production if:
- No SLO defined for the service (availability, latency, error rate)
- No alerting policy tied to SLO breach
- No runbook for the primary failure modes
- No dashboard covering the golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, saturation)
- Log-based metrics not configured for key error paths

## Golden Signals (per GCP service)

| Signal | Cloud Run | GKE | BigQuery | Cloud Storage |
|--------|-----------|-----|----------|---------------|
| Latency | request latency p50/p99 | pod request latency | query duration | object read latency |
| Traffic | request count | RPS per pod | bytes processed | object operations |
| Errors | 5xx rate | pod restart count | job failure count | 4xx/5xx rate |
| Saturation | instance count vs max | node CPU/mem | slot utilization | — |

## Runbook Template

```markdown
# Runbook: <Service> — <Failure Mode>
Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Owner: gcp-ops

## Symptoms
<What alerts fire, what users see>

## Diagnosis Steps
1. Check Cloud Logging: <query>
2. Check Cloud Monitoring: <dashboard link>
3. Check GCP status page: https://status.cloud.google.com

## Remediation
<Step-by-step fix>

## Escalation
<Who to page, when, how>

## Post-Incident
<What to update in retrospect>
```
