# IAM — Identity and Access Management

Control who (identity) can do what (role) on which GCP resource. Always least-privilege.

## Principles

1. **Least privilege** — grant the minimum role needed. Prefer predefined roles over basic roles. Never grant `roles/owner` or `roles/editor` programmatically.
2. **Service accounts for workloads** — not user accounts. Use Workload Identity to avoid SA key files.
3. **IAM Conditions** — scope bindings by resource, time, or request attribute where possible.
4. **Audit regularly** — `gcloud projects get-iam-policy` to review bindings; remove stale grants.

## Core Patterns

### Grant a predefined role

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:SA@PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.invoker"
```

### Create a service account

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create SA_NAME \
  --display-name="Description" \
  --project PROJECT_ID
```

### List effective permissions on a resource

```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy PROJECT_ID \
  --flatten="bindings[].members" \
  --format="table(bindings.role,bindings.members)"
```

### IAM Condition (time-bound access)

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:USER@example.com" \
  --role="roles/viewer" \
  --condition="expression=request.time < timestamp('2026-12-31T00:00:00Z'),title=temp-access"
```

## Never Do

- Grant `roles/owner` or `roles/editor` to service accounts or automation
- Create SA key files when Workload Identity is available
- Share service account keys across environments
